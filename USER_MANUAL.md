# Genome Size Pipeline
 
Estimating genome size from long-read sequencing data. Extending [Richard Edwards implementation](https://github.com/slimsuite/diploidocus) and incorporating additional read filtering, insertion/deletion bias and adjustments to account for read clipping.
 
Pipeline launches multiple scripts to predict genome size from a genome assembly and a BAM file of mapped long-read data. Pipeline produces multiple size predictions use a variety of assumptions in each calculation.
